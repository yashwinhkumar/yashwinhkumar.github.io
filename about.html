                     What made YASHWIN, NIKHIL and KRISHNA build a platform that is Changing the way NMIT eats?
                    </p>
                    <p style="color:white;">
                        NMIT CAFE is a phoenix that rose out of YASHWIN & NIKHIL'S earlier venture, NMIT INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY. After a slow start, NMIT CAFE snowballed
                        into an unstoppable force that is now changing the way NMIT eats. What happened along the way?

                                </div>
                                <div class="modal-body">
                                    <p style="color:white;">It all started back in 2018 when two CSE students, YASHWIN and KRISHNA decided they wanted to make life easier by changing the way India eats - all
                                        with just a tap! With their idea of hyperlocal food cafe, all they needed was
                                        the tech to power it and were introduced to SUPRIYA MAM, who brought this vision
                                        to life with the first website. And with this, NMIT CAFE was launched as a food ordering
                                        & delivery platform.</p>
                                    <<p style="color:white;">In FEB of 2019, NMIT CAFE began operations by signing up web technology project on food website in
                                       NMIT INSTITUTE Bangalore. Soon enough, the first team of Hunger Saviors came into action to deliver
                                        food within 40 minutes. Shortly after, NMIT CAFE raised its first round of funding and
                                        launched the project in March of 2019. Fun fact: The technology that delivers great food
                                        right to your taste was completely developed in-house! </p>
                                    <p style="color:white;">With love and support from consumers, NMIT CAFE expanded far and wide, the
                                        rest is history. </p>
                                    <p style="color:white;">Today, NMIT CAFE is the leading food ordering platform in India. The innovative
                                        technology, large service and exceptional consumer focus at
                                        NMIT CAFE enabled a host of benefits that includes lightning fast service, live user opinions and overwhelmed feedbacks, all while having the pleasure of enjoying
                                        your favourite meal wherever you'd like it.</p>
